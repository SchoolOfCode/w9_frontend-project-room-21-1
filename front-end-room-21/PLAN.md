branch: \* searchbar-functionality

aim: we want to make the searchbar component as functional as possible

it will need to update a text state with the input when a button is clicked

then, it will send a get request for bootcampers by name or region with the text that's sent

- move the handle functions from Searchbar.js into app.js
